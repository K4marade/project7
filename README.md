### Installation 

* If you're on MacOS, you can install Pipenv easily with Homebrew:

    $ brew install pipenv

Otherwise, refer to [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) documentation for instructions.

* Once you installed pipenv, clone project repository and install from Pipfile:

    $ pipenv install  

* Next, activate the Pipenv shell:

    $ pipenv shell
    
    This will spawn a new shell subprocess, which can be deactivated by using `exit`.

* Make sure to create a [Google billing acount](https://cloud.google.com/) and get a [Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to use Google Maps API

### Usage

_From localhost:_
* From project source directory, run `run.py` (i.g.: `python3 run.py`)

* Go to your browser and enter your localhost url

_Deploying on Heroku server:_

* Create an account on [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and read the [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
